big data:
5 v's :-
	velocity	- 0.4 million hours of yt is uploded every day
	volume		- 2.5 quantillion bytes of data is created every day
	variety		- tweets,searches,likes
	veracity	- accuracy of data
	value		
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By 2020, about 1.7 megabytes of new information
will be created every second for every
human being in the world.
By 2020, the data we create and copy
will reach around 35 zettabytes,
up from only 7.9 zettabytes today.
The chart on the right shows the growth
in global data in zettabytes.
Note the jump from 2015 to 2020 of 343%.

A large multi-radio telescope project
called Square Kilometer Array, or SKA,
produced about 1000 petabytes, in 2011 at least,
of raw data a day.
It is projected that it will produce about
20,000 petabytes or 20 billion gigabytes of data each day in 2020.

One can use the following process to make sense of big data.
Determine problem.
	What is the business problem?
	What is the project objective?
	What would you do if you had all the data?
Collect data.
	Which data is relevant?
	Are there any privacy issues?
Explore the data.
	Plot the data.
	Are there any patterns?
Analyze the data.
	Build a model.
	Fit the model.
	Validate the model.
Storytelling.
	Visualization plus communication.
	Can we tell a story?
Take action and make decisions.
